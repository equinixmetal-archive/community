# Equinix Metal Community Code of Conduct

Facilitate healthy and constructive community behavior by adopting and enforcing a code of conduct.

## Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Equinix Metal team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Equinix Metal projects. This includes Slack, GitHub, Equinix Metal events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing EMAIL ADDRESS. For more details please see our [Reporting Guidelines](reporting-guidelines.html).

* **Be friendly and patient.**

* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Equinix Metal community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Equinix Metal community.

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    * Discriminatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    * Unwelcome sexual attention.
    * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

* **Repeated harassment of others.** In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Equinix Metal is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Equinix Metal comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Reporting Guide
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the Equinix Metal group by emailing [EMAIL ADDRESS](). All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

### In your report please include:
* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public slack logger) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?
You will receive an email from the Equinix Metal Code of Conduct Working Group acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for much sooner).

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Who the bad actor was.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working group’s immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Equinix Metal spaces (mailing lists, slack, etc.)
* A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

### What if your report concerns a possible violation by a working group member?
If your report concerns a current member of the Code of Conduct working group, you may not feel comfortable sending your report to the group, as all members will see the report.

In that case, you can make a report directly to any or all of the current (vice/co) chairs of the Code of Conduct working group. Their email addresses are listed on the [Code of Conduct Working Group](working-group.html) page. The chairs will follow the usual enforcement process with the other members, but will exclude the member(s) that the report concerns from any discussion or decision making.

If your report concerns all current (vice/co) chairs of the working group, please send your report directly to the Equinix Metal Developer Relations leadership team at [EMAIL]() instead.

## Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration of the committee’s decision. To make such a request, contact the Equinix Metal Developer Relations leadership team at [EMAIL]() with your request and motivation and the Equinix Metal Developer Relations leadership group will review the case.
