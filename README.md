## The Equinix Metal Community GitHub pages

The Equinix Metal Community is a space for bare metal administrators, developers, and friends to chat and support one another in an inclusive, playful, and so very metal space.

This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style! This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.
