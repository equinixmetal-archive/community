Hope you’re all having a wonderful Wednesday today. We’ve got a slight change-up with how we’re sharing our CFP opportunities this week - you’re going to see who the rockstars are who want to get out there and talk! We’re sharing CFP commitments as well.

## This Week
We have a shared super hero status for two of the devrel folks this week. McKay did a live stream on Recovering Your Packet Servers with Serial Over SSH (SOS) then joined Rain for a deep-dive into Open Stack on Packet. Thank you, McKay and Rain!
