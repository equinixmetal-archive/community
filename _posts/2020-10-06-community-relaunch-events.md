Come celebrate all the excitement of our community relaunch with [Equinix Metal](http://metal.equinix.com/)! We’re planning weekly fun events (watch out for the Halloween themed one...)!

Every Monday, we'll make an announcement in the Equinix Metal Community Slack with the goals for the week. At the end of the week, we'll give a short report on the week's activity. If you'd like to suggest a week's theme, message @Mo.Metal and / or @Rain.Metal at any time.

## Feedback Week

2020-10-12 This week we’re asking for your thoughts / ideas / feedback ranging from a new integration, a new feature, or even a new data center (IBX). There are many already submitted, but we welcome yours as well! If there is an item listed on the roadmap and/or already submitted do up-vote it so our team knows.

## Hacktoberfest Week

2020-10-19 What are you doing this month for Hacktoberfest? Did you know we have a couple of repositories that already have the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic? Would you like to work on something on our packethost, packet-labs, and tinkerbell orgs? Our Developer Advocate, @Rain.Metal, streamed with Raise.Devs about how to participate within Hacktoberfest, if you’re keen.

## Social Media Week

2020-10-26 Let’s celebrate the new @EquinixMetal brand on all the socials! We’d love to hear from you via Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, your personal blog and anywhere else you call home. Be sure to use #EquinixMetal so we can find your post with extra love for using #madeonmetal and DOUBLE points for your MOST metal pictures! 

## Find Our F*ck Ups
