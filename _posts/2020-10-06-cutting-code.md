New integrations and other tooling we’ve made with you in mind

## Integrations

Our Terraform provider is [now published on Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/packethost/packet/latest) which means it now meets uniform Terraform standards and is more easily findable.

Our [VMware Terraform guide](https://github.com/packet-labs/packet-tanzu-tf) is being updated to simplify the installation for the VMware NSX (Networking) components so it’s easier to deploy VMware Tanzu from scratch.

We now have an [Automated Anthos Installation via Terraform](https://github.com/packet-labs/google-anthos) which is one of our Maintained repos.

## Tinkerbell

In case you didn’t know, [Tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org/) answers the question of “How do I spin up a bare metal server programmatically?”. It’s an OSS project created by [Equinix Metal](http://metal.equinix.com/). If this sounds interesting, now’s a great time to check it out! We’d love your feedback on how to improve it. 

## Latest updates
* Continues to mature and become more stable. 
* To make life easier for our end-users there is now the Tinkerbell [“sandbox”](https://github.com/tinkerbell/sandbox) which is a stable release of Tinkerbell for our end-users.
* We’ve also introduced [public community meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cEObfvQ9Tdp8zIIIg9O7P5i3CKaSj2t3JTxEufDxwWs/edit?usp=sharing) every week that are recorded and live on the [Tinkerbell Youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTzWInTQPvzH21KHS8jrq7A). Please join us!
* We’ll be introducing a number of webinars for the community that delve into various parts and specifics around bare-metal provisioning and how Tinkerbell fits in today and where it is potentially going in the future.
