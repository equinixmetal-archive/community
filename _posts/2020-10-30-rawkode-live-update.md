It‚Äôs time for your Rawkode Live update. I‚Äôve started highlighting metrics, and this will remain to in future editions, for people to skim. I‚Äôm too nice, I know.

## This Week

This week there were 3 live streams:

* [Spinning Up Equinix Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XTefee6WYg) with DevRel Marketing üèÜ
* [Introduction to Grafana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA_rxeUftQQ) with Marcus Olsson (Grafana Labs)
* [Introduction to Falco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jJaDf6BYJQ) with Leo DiDonato (Sysdig) and Lorenzo Fontana (Sysdig)

In the **last 7 days**:

* **44** (vs 34) **new subscribers**, totalling 355.
* **1000** (vs 821) **views of content**, totalling 6.4k.
* **145** (vs 145) hours of content viewed, totalling 856.2.
* **9.3k** (vs 7k) **impressions** of my content on YouTube search, 14% (vs 23%) of this from YouTube recommendations with, with a 2.8% (vs 2.4%) conversion

Numbers are still increasing, week on week; but linearly and slowly. Will be looking at this with Jeremy and Thom, to identify opportunities and avenues for further promotion of the content.

These stats are obviously our vanity metrics; there serve nothing more than a pulse for the work that we‚Äôre doing with the stream is being received by our audience. In the DevRel Marketing team, we refer to this as our **Awareness Initiative**.
